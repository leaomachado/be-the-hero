# About

**Be The Hero** is a didactic project that was developed during Rocketseat's 
OmniStack 11.0 week to meet a challenge of the event. The application consists 
of a simple client-server system, where non-governmental organizations can 
register cases of social actions and interested volunteers can contribute to 
such action, donating a certain amount of money. The application structure is 
divided into three generic parts: a RESTful web API on the back-end, a front-end on 
React and a mobile client on React Native.
